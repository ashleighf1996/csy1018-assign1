    <h4 class="heading4">Summary</h4>
    <p class="paragraphCV1">
      Computing and IT in general has captivated me since a very young age. I started using computers at school at the age of 5 and due to the fact that I’ve grown up around the time technology has been evolving and changing quite rapidly, I’ve become very keen to learn more. I was studying a Level 3 Extended Diploma in IT at Milton Keynes College and finished this course back in June 2016. This course has improved my skills to an advanced level where I’ve been achieving distinctions throughout each of the subjects that I have studied.  This has helped me gain both theoretical and practical knowledge as well as extending my love of IT even more. I am now currently studying BSc Business Computing (Systems) at the University of Northampton.

    <h4 class="heading4">Hobbies and Interests</h4>
    <p class="paragraphCV1">
      In my spare time, I like to play the flute and have reached Grade 6 level and have also attended LAMDA speech and drama lessons gaining a Grade 6 certificate.  Singing is also a passion of mine and I have used my singing skills to edit my voice using Audacity as well as achieving a Grade 5 qualification in singing.  I also find that I am called to help family and friends with both computer and mobile phone problems, sometimes within my dad’s business which I particularly like helping with. In the past, I have also attended the school choir and the school orchestra during lunchtimes. I have also been completing tutorials on “the digital garage” website which is run by Google. This website was recommended to us by one of our tutors in order to expand our knowledge of the online marketing world as well as learning about SEO (search engine optimisation) which is part of our social media unit at the college.
