      <h1 class="bioheader">About Ashleigh Claire Foster</h1>
      <hr />
      <p class="biotext"> Ashleigh is known by her friends and fellow peers as an intelligent and a clever minded individual who is determined to work hard and succeed at whatever she puts her mind too. They have commented on her ability to work well as a team player when dealing with challenging projects. Some of her teachers in the past and the present have regarded her as a hard-working individual who works hard at what she does best. This has been shown by her achieving 100% attendance at college and when she was working as a dental nurse as well as achieving distinction* distinction* distinction* on her Level 3 Cambridge technical in Information & Creative Technology (ICT). Although she maybe a shy individual at heart she is always willing to improve her skills in this area and hopes that university will help her to improve her skills through a series of presentations that she must do as part of her course. Some people have even described her as someone who likes to crack the odd joke here and there to lighten the mood! </p>
      <p class="biotext">She likes to help a lot of people out with any problems they might be facing whether it be something in regards to class work or just general help as she has been put in a position in the past which she doesn’t want others to be put in. Sometimes even complete strangers who she doesn’t ever talk to in class come up to her and ask her for help! This shows that she is a trustworthy, kind and a responsible person that is well respected. However, she realises that some people can use this to their advantage as once stated in a quote by Frederick L Collins &ldquo;There are two types of people – those who come into a room and say, well, here I am! And those who come in and say, ah, there you are&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="biotext">In her spare time, she likes to sing songs and has used her singing skills to edit her singing voice using Audacity as shown in the audio clips below. She likes to help her family out with any computer problems that they may be having as she is usually the go to person who fixes their problems! Including problems which arise in her dads business. She has also taken flute, singing and speech and drama classes when she was at school and has reached grade 6 on all of them except singing which was grade 5.</p>
      <p class="biotext">She loves and adores cats and she even has a cat called Mufasa who is a Maine Coon cat! As shown in the pictures below. One of her favourite holiday destinations is Florida as she loves the fact that it’s warm, peaceful, and relaxing! She has taken several Florida pictures which are shown below of some of the things she has experienced whilst at Florida. She just keeps going back there every summer because she enjoys it so much!!!</p>
      <p class="biotext">She is hoping that the University of Northampton will be able to help her to improve her skills in not just speaking but also in the computing world wherever that may take her! She is willing to learn, succeed and do well even if it requires her to put in the extra effort to achieve what she wants in life. There is a quote by Kirsten Gillibrand which states &ldquo;My hope is that in the future, the women stop referring themselves as the &ldquo;only woman&rdquo; in their physics lab or &ldquo;only one of two&rdquo; in their computer science jobs&rdquo; and she takes inspiration from this quote in that she wants to be one of those women who shows that women can do computing when they set their mind to it! She is hoping to improve her skills in the computing field by learning how to code and solve problems in computing as well as learning how computing has changed our lives for the better!</p>
      <p class="biotext">&ldquo;Success isn’t just about learning. It is about questioning everything you do so that you can learn from your mistakes&rdquo;. Nobody is perfect in life, even though sometimes I think that way (opps)! As Albert Einstein once said &ldquo;The important thing is not to stop questioning&rdquo; as that is how we learn best.</p>
      <p class="biotext">Here are some recordings of her singing voice:</p>
