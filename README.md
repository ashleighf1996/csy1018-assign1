##Colour Scheme

For the background colour I used the same background colour as was used on the Wix website. For the rest of the website I decided to think about not only a more professional view but also one that will make my CV website stand out, especially for colour blind users. I decided to incorporate a black, grey, and white theme with a hint of blue every now and then.

##Navigation Diagram

The main purpose of constructing and designing a navigation structured diagram is to show that all of the webpages in my “simple CV portfolio website” link up together when it comes to finally building the overall website.

##Logo

I decided to choose the first design because I thought that it would look simpler and more professional plus it is a type of logo which is commonly used in CV websites or portfolio website i.e. having the letters merged together.I then went ahead and took the colour scheme of my website into consideration and then started to design the logo in Adobe Photoshop. The types of effects I used when designing the overall layout of the logo were “Bevel & Emboss” and “Gradient overlay”. The font size which was used was 72 pt. and the font style is “Imprint MT shadow”.
